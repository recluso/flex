73km with a steep 1,880 metres of climbing.  It was a good and challenging ride.  I was totally alone on the roads for the majority. Most of the climbs were very steep and long. I am very happy with myself - I did ride all the climbs, there was no walking my bike or pushing it up the hill.  It did wipe me out.
