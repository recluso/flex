## First flex Wednesday, 8 weeks into lockdown in the UK

I decided I should  use my flex time for something useful.  So I went on a long ride which passed through a couple of places I used to live and do not have warm feelings for. But I also got in a good long ride with some nice stretches.  I will try to make a habit o this.
